.Sh NAME
.Nm usbdump
.Nd "dump traffic on USB host controller"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar [ugen]B
.Op Fl d Ar [ugen]B.D
.Op Fl d Ar [ugen]B.D.E
.Op Fl i Ar ifname
.Op Fl r Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar snaplen
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl w Ar file
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl b Ar file
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a way to dump USB packets on host controllers.
.Pp
The following options are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl f Ar file"
.It Fl d Ar [ugen]bus
Shortcut for
.Fl i
option.
The argument may be prefixed by "ugen".
The option may be specified multiple times, but the bus specified must
be the same.
.It Fl d Ar [ugen]bus.device , Fl d Ar [ugen]bus.device.endpoint
Shortcut for
.Fl i
and
.Fl f
options.
The argument may be prefixed by "ugen".
The option may be specified multiple times, but the bus specified must
be the same.
.It Fl b Ar file
Write the raw packet data without any headers to the given
.Ar file .
This option does not work with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl i Ar ifname
Listen on USB bus interface
.Ar ifname .
.It Fl r Ar file
Read the raw packets from
.Ar file .
.It Fl s Ar snaplen
Snapshot
.Ar snaplen
bytes from each packet.
.It Fl v
Enable debugging messages.
When defined multiple times the verbosity level increases.
.It Fl w Ar file
Write the raw packets to
.Ar file .
This option does not work with the
.Fl b
option.
.It Fl f Ar filter
The filter argument consists of either one or two numbers separated by a dot.
The first indicates the device unit number which should be traced.
The second number which is optional indicates the endpoint which should be traced.
To get all traffic for the control endpoint, two filters should be
created, one for endpoint 0 and one for endpoint 128.
If 128 is added to the endpoint number that means IN direction, else OUT direction is implied.
A device unit or endpoint value of -1 means ignore this field.
If no filters are specified, all packets are passed through using the default -1,-1 filter.
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl p
Do not ignore device unit number filters which overlap device endpoint filters.
Without this option, if a unit filter overlaps any endpoint filters, the unit filter
is ignored and only the endpoint filters are used to limit output.
.It Fl h
This option displays a summary of the command line options.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Capture the USB raw packets on usbus2:
.Pp
.Dl "usbdump -i usbus2 -s 256 -v"
.Pp
Dump the USB raw packets of usbus2 into the file without packet
size limit:
.Pp
.Dl "usbdump -i usbus2 -s 0 -w /tmp/dump_pkts"
.Pp
Dump the USB raw packets of usbus2, but only the control endpoint traffic
of device unit number 3:
.Pp
.Dl "usbdump -i usbus2 -s 0 -f 3.0 -f 3.128 -w /tmp/dump_pkts"
.Pp
Read and display the USB raw packets from previous file:
.Pp
.Dl "usbdump -r /tmp/dump_pkts -v"
.Pp
Display the USB raw packets from usbus2 unit 3, with equivalent combinations of arguments:
.Pp
.Dl "usbdump -i usbus2 -f 3"
.Dl "usbdump -d ugen2 -f 3"
.Dl "usbdump -d ugen2.3"
.Pp
Display the USB raw packets from usbus2 unit 3 endpoint 4, with equivalent combinations of arguments:
.Pp
.Dl "usbdump -i usbus2 -f 3.4"
.Dl "usbdump -d ugen2 -f 3.4"
.Dl "usbdump -d ugen2.3 -f .4"
.Dl "usbdump -d ugen2.3.4"
.Pp
Note: if the
.Fl p
option is specified, the third command will match all packets on endpoint 4.
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
The output format of
.Nm
is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl "<time> <bus>.<addr> <ep> <xfertype> <S/D> (<frames>/<length>) <...>"
.Pp
The meaning of the output format elements is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "<xfertype>"
.It <time>
A timestamp preceding all output lines.
The timestamp has the format "hh:mm:ss.frac" and is as accurate as
the kernel's clock.
.It <bus>
The USB host controller's bus unit number.
.It <addr>
The unique number of the USB device as allocated by the host controller driver.
.It <ep>
The USB endpoint address that indicates whether the address is
.Dv OUT
or
.Dv IN .
.It <xfertype>
The USB transfer type.
Can be
.Dv CTRL ,
.Dv ISOC ,
.Dv BULK
or
.Dv INTR .
.It <S/D>
`S' indicates a USB submit.
`D' indicates a USB transfer done.
.It <frames>
Numbers of frames in this packets.
If this is a USB submit, its value is
.Li xfer->nframes
which means how many frames are acceptable or registered to transfer.
If this is a USB done,
.Li xfer->aframes
is the actual number of frames.
.It <length>
Total packet size.
If this is a USB submit, its value is
.Li xfer->sumlen .
If this is a USB done, its value is
.Li xfer->actlen .
.It <...>
Optional field used for printing an error string if the packet is from USB done.
.El
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Originally, unit filters which overlapped endpoint filters would cause the endpoint
filters to have no effect, as the unit filters would accept all packets, including
those which might not match any endpoint filters.
.Pp
This behavior is corrected by automatically removing any unit filters which overlap
any endpoint or unit.endpoint filters.
To disable automatic removal and revert to the old behavior, invoke with the
.Fl p
option.
